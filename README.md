### Fallback Learning Lab:
- Copy the smart contract address code and paste it into a new file in the Remix IDE.
- In Remix IDE, click the `Deploy & RUN TRANSACTIONS` tab, then click the select box under the `ENVIRONMENT` heading and select the `Injected Provider: MetaMask` option. 
- Copy the smart contract address, which is under the heading `Your Test Address`, navigate to Remix IDE, and paste the contract address in the `At Address` input box. Next, click the `At Address` button to enable access to the deployed smart contract's user interface.
- Now click on the newly created tab under the heading `Deployed Contracts`, then click on the `Transact` button, which is under the heading `CALLDATA` and confirm the transaction. (To verify that the transaction was successfully completed, click the `FixMe` button in Remix IDE or on the game website and check that the value has changed to true.)
- Navigate to the game site and click the `Submit` button.

---

### Balance Learning Lab:
- Select a wallet address or contract address and copy it (don't select your wallet address as your wallet balance will change once you call the function).
- Enter the address you copied into the `_account` input box.
- Open the code editor you use and create an index.js file with the following code:
``` javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const https = '<your-rpc-provider>';
const web3 = new Web3(https);

async function balance(){
const bal = await web3.eth.getBalance("<paste-address-here>")
console.log(bal);
  }
balance()

```
- Replace the <paste-address-here> with the address that you copied and run the script.
- Copy the balance from the terminal.
- Navigate to the game site and enter the balance you copied into the `_amount` input box.
- Press the `checkBalance` button and confirm the transaction.

---

### Wei Learning Lab:
- Copy the smart contract code address and paste it into a new file in the Remix IDE.

- Copy the smart contract address, which is under the heading `Your Test Address`, navigate to Remix IDE, and paste the contract address in the `At Address` input box. Next, click the `At Address` button to enable access to the deployed smart contract's user interface.
- Enter the number 1 in the input box under the heading `VALUE`, ensuring that the ETHEREUM UNIT is set to Wei.
- Now click on the newly created tab under the heading `Deployed Contracts`, then click on the `Transact` button under the heading `CALDATA` and confirm the transaction. (To verify that the transaction was successfully completed, note that the amount of ETH sent to the contract is equal to Balance: 0.000000000000000001 ETH.)

const Web3 = require('web3');
const https = '<your-rpc-provider>';
const web3 = new Web3(https);
web3.eth.getBlock("<Block-Number>",console.log)
```

### Gas Learning Lab:
1. **Base Gas Consumption (Overhead)**:  When the complexOperation function is called with the argument `0`, it consumes a certain amount of gas, let's call it `x` units. This `x` represents the base gas cost for executing the function without entering the loop. This includes the cost of reading and writing to storage, and other computational overheads.
2. **Gas Consumption for a Single Iteration**: When you invoke the function with an argument of `1`, it results in a gas consumption of `y` units. This includes the base gas cost `x` plus the gas cost of one iteration of the loop.

Using the above data:
```
Gas Per Iteration = y - x = z units
```
To find the average gas consumption between 3000 and 5000:
```
Average Gas Consumption = (3000 + 5000) / 2 = 4000 units
```
Applying this to our function's gas consumption pattern:
```
x + z*n = 4000
=> z*n = 4000 - x
=> n â‰ˆ (4000 - x) / z
```
Thus, it is deduced that about `n` iterations are requisite to approach an average gas consumption of 4000 units.
- Enter the number `n` in the `iterations` input box.
- Click the `complexOperation` button and confirm the transaction.

### Password Learning Lab:
- Copy the smart contract address, which is under the heading `Your Test Address`.
- Open the code editor you use and create an index.js file with the following code:
```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const https = '<your-rpc-provider>';
const web3 = new Web3(https);
web3.eth.getStorageAt("<contract-address>",0,console.log)
```
- Replace `<contract-address>` with the smart contract address you copied.
- Run the script and copy the hexadecimal number from the received output.
- Enter the hexadecimal number in the input box `_password`.
- Enter any number in the `newPassword` input box.
- Click the `changePassword` button and confirm the transaction.

---

### Overflow Learning Lab:
(type(uint256).max) = Max


`(counter = Max - 3)[---------(counter + 3 = Max)---(counter + 4 = 0)---------](counter + 7 = 3)`


When the `counter` starts at `Max - 3`, the overflow logic is:

1. When `3` uints are added to the counter, it reaches `Max`.
2. Adding to the starting value `4` causes an overflow, resetting the counter to `0`.
3. If `7` is added to the starting value, the counter wraps around and becomes `3`.

- Enter the number 7 in the `value` input box.
- Click the `add` button and confirm the transaction.
